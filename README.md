# CareFlow Hackathon Build 🚀

Adaptive medication management for families.

## How to Run
Since this is a Vanilla JS + Tailwind CDN build, you only need a static file server.

1. **Option A (VS Code)**: Install "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live" on `index.html`.
2. **Option B (Python)**: Run `python -m http.server` in this directory and open `localhost:8000`.
3. **Option C (Simple)**: Just open `index.html` in Chrome (Note: Service Worker might need localhost context to work fully, but UI will work).

## Demo Script
1. Reload to see Splash + Onboarding.
2. Click upload and select **any file named `Pan-D_Figma.jpg`** (or just click upload, a fallback demo mode is active).
3. Experience the "Exact Recognition" flow.
4. On Dashboard, switch Roles (Asha/Dad).
5. Click a medication to "Mark as Taken" -> See Photo Proof toast.
6. Check "Evening skips" banner -> Click Adapt -> Use slider.
7. Settings -> Toggle "Low-tech Mode" for grandpa-friendly fonts.
